Since we can't create an actual SVG heatmap without Strava credentials, this is a placeholder file.

For a working implementation, you would need to:
1. Set up your Strava API credentials
2. Run the tool with actual activity data
3. The generated SVG would be used in place of this placeholder

An actual rendered example would look similar to GitHub's contribution graph but with colors based on your Strava activity metrics.
